            <p>Hi, I’m a recent high school graduate with a deep interest in web development. Although I'm a beginner, I have dedicated myself to learning the basics of HTML and CSS, building a solid foundation for creating web pages. I have also started to explore the fundamentals of JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS. Each project I take on is a step toward mastering these technologies, and I’m excited about the journey ahead. <br>My goal is to become a skilled front-end developer, creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites. I enjoy the creative and technical aspects of coding, and I’m always ready to learn new techniques, explore different design concepts, and improve my skills. This field may be challenging, but I embrace every challenge as a learning opportunity. I am eager to continue growing, discovering new tools, and bringing ideas to life on the web.</p>
